This implementation contains PyTorch code for 4 models solving Supervised Clustering:
 - Deep Amortized Clustering --- src/dac.py
 - Attention Based Clustering --- src/atbc.py
 - Multiple Instance Learning model --- src/mil.py
 - Permutation Equivariance Model  --- src/permequi.py


Scripts for running individual models on individual datasets are in the folder scripts/ .
Only the Circles and MoG datasets are available.
